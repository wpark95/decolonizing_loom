    <h1>Nuclear History: A Story of Ambition and Violence</h1>

    <h3>Abundance of Negligence</h3>
    <p>Nuclear weapons hold a special place in U.S. history, culture, and politics.<br></br>
       The deification of nuclear weapons as the keystone of national security has allowed the U.S. government an unprecedented level of privilege to freely violate, extract, and destroy individuals and communities.<br></br> 
       Among the American public, nuclear weapons are often discussed exclusively in terms of the final product: the actual bomb.<br></br>
       What is rarely discussed is the astounding amount of research and tests that go into their development.<br></br>

       (Also talk about how nuclear weapons development and testing has ocurred in the form of colonization, targetting communities near Hanford and the Marshall Islands)
